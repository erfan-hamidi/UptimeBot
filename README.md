- **Task Queue:** Celery with Redis
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (or SQLite for local development)
- **API Documentation:** Swagger (via drf-yasg)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL (or SQLite for local development)
- Redis (for Celery)
- Virtualenv (optional but recommended)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/uptimebot.git
    cd uptimebot
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Configure the database:**

    Update the `DATABASES` setting in `uptimebot/settings.py` to point to your PostgreSQL database. For local development, you can use SQLite aslo can use Postgresql:

    ```python
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': BASE_DIR / "db.sqlite3",
        }
    }
    ```

5. **Run database migrations:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6. **Create a superuser:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

7. **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

8. **Start Redis (if not already running):**

    ```bash
    redis-server
    ```

9. **Start the Celery worker and Celery Beat scheduler:**

    In separate terminal windows, run:

    ```bash
    celery -A uptimebot worker -l info
    celery -A uptimebot beat -l info
    ```
